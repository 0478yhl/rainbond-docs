### version change

[5.3.1 Version Changes](/community/change/5.3.1)

### Console upgrade

To upgrade from v5.2.2-release to v5.3.1-release, you need to upgrade the console and the cluster respectively.The current chapter section describes the console upgrade steps.Video tutorials are provided throughout the process, see the end of the article for details.

#### database backup

Before upgrading the console, you need to back up and upgrade the database used by the console.By default, the operation needs to enter the `rbd-db-0` database container environment to operate. If your Rainbond is connected to an external database, please backup and upgrade (sql) as appropriate.

- backup

```bash
# Log in to rbd-db-0 for data backup, the object is console region library
kubectl exec -ti rbd-db-0 -n rbd-system -- bash

mysqldump -uroot -p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD} --databases console > /var/lib /mysql/console.sql
mysqldump -uroot -p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD} --databases region > /var/lib/mysql/region.sql

# The backup file is located in the following location of the master node by default, if your cluster does not use the default nfs share storage, then you need to manually find the persistence path of
-db8 ls /opt/rainbond/data/db*/mysql/*.sql
```

- Upgrade the console library

```bash
# Log in to rbd-db-0 to perform operations
kubectl exec -ti rbd-db-0 -n rbd-system -- bash

curl https://grstatic.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/docs/5.3/upgrade /5.2.2-5.3.0.sql -o /5.2.2-5.3.0.sql
curl https://grstatic.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/docs/5.3/upgrade/5.3.0- 5.3.1.sql -o /5.3.0-5.3.1.sql

mysql -uroot -p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD} -Dconsole -e 'source /5.2.2-5.3.0.sql'
mysql -uroot -p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD} -Dconsole -e 'source/5.3.0-5.3.1.sql'
```

#### Update 5.2.2 Console

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://grstatic.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/docs/5.3/upgrade/rbd-app-ui-5.2.2.1-rbdcomponent.yaml
```

Confirm the status of rbd-app-ui:

```bash
 kubectl get po -l name=rbd-app-ui -n rbd-system
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
rbd-app-ui-7c6877cc9f-ph5pc 1/1 Running 0 90s
```

#### Install the new version of the console

- Install Apps from Open Source App Stores **Rainbond - Open Source**
- Register the console database originally used by the cluster in the deployed **Rainbond-Open Source** application in the form of a third-party component, fill in the static registration address: `rbd-db-rw.rbd-system:3306`, add the required connection information Environment variable, replacing `Mysql5.7` databases in **Rainbond-Open Source**.Database If your Rainbond is connected to an external database, please add the corresponding environment variables directly for the `Rainbond-console` and `cluster installation driver service` that depend on the database.After the replacement of the database is complete, update the two service components described above.The specific environment variables added are shown in the following table：

| Connection information environment variable name |          environment variable value          |
|:------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
|                     DB_TYPE                      |                    mysql                     |
|                     MYSQL_DB                     |                   console                    |
|                    MYSQL_USER                    |                     root                     |
|                    MYSQL_PASS                    | <查询 rbd-db-0 容器中 ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD} 值> |

- Change the cluster API address to the gateway IP. If your cluster has multiple gateways, please fill in the VIP or load balancer address.

  ![Modify API address](https://static.goodrain.com/docs/5.3/upgrade/5.3.0-upgrade-1.png)


#### Process the original console

The original console refers to the `rbd-app-ui-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx` pods created by default in the `rbd-system` namespace during installation, and the rbdcomponents, deployment and other resources involved in maintaining these pods.Since it involves the replacement of new and old resources, it is strongly recommended to perform the operation steps of the original console after the subsequent cluster-side upgrade operation.

By editing the rbdcomponents resource customized by Rainbond, the following configuration can be performed for the original console to complete the upgrade action：

- Mirror address use `registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/goodrain/rainbond:v5.3.1-release-allinone`
- Add environment variable DB_TYPE=mysql
- Add new pvc mount

All changes are made in `spec` paragraph：

```bash
kubectl edit rbdcomponents.rainbond.io rbd-app-ui -n rbd-system

  spec:
    env:
    - name: DB_TYPE
      value: mysql
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /root/.ssh
      name: app
      subPath : ssh
    image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/goodrain/rainbond:v5.3.1-release-allinone
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    priorityComponent: false
    replicas: 1
    resources: {}
```

> After installing the **Rainbond-Open Source** console in the cluster, the original console can exist as an operation and maintenance backdoor. It is only enabled when the **Rainbond-Open Source** fault cannot be accessed. Usually, you can set `replicas` to 0 to close it. pod to achieve the purpose of saving resources.


### Cluster side upgrade

To upgrade from v5.2.2-release to v5.3.1-release, you need to upgrade the console and the cluster respectively.The current chapter describes the cluster-side upgrade steps.Video tutorials are provided throughout the process, see the end of the article for details.

#### Update Rainbond CRD resources

```bash
# Load CRD configuration file
kubectl apply -f https://grstatic.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/docs/5.3/upgrade/monitoring.coreos.com_servicemonitors.yaml
```

#### Update the rainbond-operator component

```bash
# Delete the old rainbond-operator statefulset
kubectl delete sts rainbond-operator -n rbd-system 

# Create a new rainbond-operator deployment
kubectl apply -f https://grstatic.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/ docs/5.3/upgrade/rainbond-operator-deployment-v2.0.1.yaml
```

#### Update build private server components

```bash
# Delete rbdcomponent
of rbd-repo kubectl delete rbdcomponents.rainbond.io rbd-repo -n rbd-system

# Create a new component rbd-resource-proxy
kubectl apply -f https://grstatic.oss-cn-shanghai. aliyuncs.com/docs/5.3/upgrade/rbd-resource-proxy-rbdcomponent-v5.3.1-release.yaml
```

#### Update grctl command

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v /:/rootfs registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/goodrain/rbd-grctl:v5.3.1-release copy
```

```bash
mv /usr/local/bin/rainbond-grctl /usr/local/bin/grctl && grctl install
```

#### Execute the upgrade command

```bash
grctl cluster upgrade --new-version=v5.3.1-release
```

#### Update other functional images

```bash
# Login 
function Login_registry(){
  inner_registry=$(kubectl get rainbondcluster -n rbd-system -o yaml | grep -v 'f:domain' | grep domain | awk '{print $2}')
  registry_user=$(kubectl get rainbondcluster -n rbd-system -o yaml | grep -v 'f:username' | grep username | awk '{print $2}')
  registry_pass=$(kubectl get rainbondcluster -n rbd-system -o yaml | grep -v 'f:password ' | grep password | awk '{print $2}')
  docker login --username ${registry_user} --password ${registry_pass} ${inner_registry}
}

# Pull image and replace, push

function Other_images(){
  from_registory=registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com /goodrain
  to_registory=goodrain.me
  for image in builder runner rbd-init-probe rbd-mesh-data-panel
    do 
      docker pull $from_registory/$image:v5.3.1-release
      docker tag $from_registory/$image:v5.3.1 -release $to_registory/$image
      docker push $to_registory/$image
    done
}

# start update
Login_registry && Other_images
```

#### Create Maven source build default configuration (optional)

This step is used to create a default settings.xml configuration required for building the java maven source code. In most scenarios, it is used to declare the private server address, user name, password and other information within the enterprise.When you do not need to customize, Rainbond will generate the Alibaba Cloud private server address by default.Therefore, this step is optional.

```bash
grctl build maven-setting add --file <absolute path of user-defined settings.xml file>
```

#### rebuild the plugin

Enter the plug-in management page, click Build on the respective management pages of the `export network management plug-in` and `service integrated network management plug-in` to update it.For the service components that have installed the above plugins, you need to reinstall the plugins to make them take effect after building the plugins.

### Upgrade verification

- Observe whether the platform version is `v5.3.1-release`in the Enterprise Information column on the overview page
- On the cluster page, check whether the platform version of the connected cluster is `v5.3.1-release`
- Check `rbd-api` `rbd-chaos` `rbd-eventlog` `rbd-gateway` `rbd-monitor` `rbd-mq` `rbd-node` `rbd-webcli` `rbd-worker` Service, whether the tag of the image it uses is `v5.3.1-release`
- Try to build the java maven project from source and verify that the `rbd-resource-proxy` service is working properly
- Follow the `New Features` chapter, try the new features one by one, and verify if they work properly

### Offline upgrade

Currently Rainbond v5.3.1-release does not provide offline upgrade packages.However, all resources in the upgrade process, including configuration files and images, can be processed offline.Users can download and localize these resources by themselves, and import them into the offline Rainbond v5.2.2-release environment for upgrade operations.

Note that：

- It is not necessary to install the **Rainbond-Open Source** console for the offline environment, just refer to the documentation to process the original console
- To add environment variable `DISABLE_DEFAULT_APP_MARKET = true`for console component.This variable is used to avoid frequent requests from the console to the open source app store in an offline environment
- When preparing for offline mirroring, do not omit the mirrors corresponding to `rainbond-operator` and `rbd-resource-proxy` The mirror addresses are defined in the `deployment.yaml` configuration file that starts them

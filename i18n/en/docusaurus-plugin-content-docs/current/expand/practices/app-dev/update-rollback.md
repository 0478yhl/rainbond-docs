title: One-click online/rollback based on Rainbond
description: This best practice explains the one-click online/rollback of applications based on Rainbond.
---


In the actual production environment, due to business upgrades, the code needs to be rolled back when an accident occurs. Rainbond implements a one-click rollback of the release version. For different business scenarios, the rollback function can be used to quickly roll back the application in the event of an accident. Roll back to the previous version to reduce business losses; Rainbond supports one-click quick rollback of a single component in the application, and also supports simultaneous rollback of multiple components in the application.

## One-click online/rollback based on version number

### Overview

The following content is for the scenario where the application is upgraded and launched through the shared library

Specific processï¼š

1. Test the application in the test environment and publish it to the shared library after the test is complete.
2. One-click installation of the application in the production environment, as a production application,
3. The simulated test environment application is upgraded and republished to the shared library, defining a new application version,
4. Upgrade the production application in the production environment and simulate a rollback operation after the upgrade fails.

### Preconditions

Done [Publish the app as an app template](/docs/use-manual/get-start/release-to-market/) , have an app installed based on the sample app template

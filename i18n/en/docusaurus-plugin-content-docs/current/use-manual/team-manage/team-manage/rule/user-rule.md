## what is permission

Permissions correspond to executable operations. Having a permission means running an operation.Rainbond's permission system is designed with two levels of control, team level control and application level control.They are an inheritance relationship.Rainbond's optional permissions are deterministic and change from version to version.What users can manage is the relationship between roles and permissions, that is, which permissions a role has.

* If you create a new team role in Team Management and bind an application-related permission to this role, these application-related permissions are valid in all applications.
* Adding an application member to an application and granting some application-related permissions will not override the application-related permissions corresponding to the member's role in the team, but will take the combination of the two permissions.
* If you want a member to view the information overview of the application group, please add the permission to view application information to the role in the member's team.

## Member management
In order to allow users to better manage teams and assign related functions, we have designed a role-based permission system.The system controls the behavior of members based on roles, and supports user-defined roles in the team. The platform sets three roles by default, which areï¼š

- team admin
- Developer
- observer

The permission system is flexible and customizable, and it also makes the granularity of permission control more delicate.

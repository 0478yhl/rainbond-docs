### Status of service components

Once the service component is created, it enters the life cycle of the service component. There will be a series of states in the entire life cycle, and each state will be explained below.Most states have a preset timeout period. Regardless of whether the timeout period is exceeded, after **3 minutes** , all life cycle operations can be performed on the service component again：：

| <font color="#40a9ff">under construction  </font> | The newly created service component setup is complete, and the first service component version build is in progress.The source code build time-out time is 1 hour, and the Dockerfile build time-out time is 30 minutes.**timeout does not mean the build failed**, refer to the build log to understand the current progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <font color="#ffa940">scheduling  </font>         | Once the service component is constructed, it will enter the scheduling state, and the color of the**instance is yellow**.In this process, the K8s assigns the host to schedule the instance.If it remains in this state for a long time, it may be because there are no host nodes to run the component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| <font color="#40a9ff">starting  </font>           | Service component is starting,**instance color is yellow**.It cannot be accessed temporarily. The startup is divided into two stages, process startup and business startup. If the health check at startup is not configured, as long as the process startup is completed, the startup is considered successful.The startup timeout is 40 seconds * number of instances.**startup timeout does not mean startup failed**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| <font color="#40a9ff">wait to start</font>        | The waiting state and the starting state will not appear at the same time. Once the waiting state is entered, the color of the**instance is yellow**.Indicates that other service components that the current service component depends on have not been started.You need to wait for the other service components it depends on to start to complete before the current service component enters the starting state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| <font color="#28cb75">running  </font>            | All running instances of the service component are in the running state, and the color of**instances is green**.Normally, the running service components can be accessed, or the application may be temporarily unavailable due to slow business startup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| <font color="red">abnormal operation  </font>     | If the number of normal instances of the service component is less than the total instances, it indicates that the application is running abnormally, and the color of**abnormal instances is red**.For multi-instance service components, the service components in the abnormal state can provide services as long as there are normal instances.Instance exceptions are mostly due to the abnormal exit of the service component itself or an OOM exit due to insufficient memory.The platform will automatically try to restart the abnormal instance.More application information can be viewed by viewing the service component log, or through command line tools |
| <font color="#40a9ff">during upgrade</font>       | The service component is in the process of rolling update,**instance color is yellow**.Service components with multiple nodes in their current state can be accessed normally.The upgrade timeout is 3 minutes * number of instances.**upgrade timeout does not mean upgrade failure**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| closed                                            | The service component has stopped running, and persistent data still exists.The shutdown timeout is 40 seconds * number of instances.If it is in the state of **shutdown and** for a long time, and the color of the**instance is black**, please contact the operation and maintenance colleagues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Join an existing team

#### Admin assignment

1. When an enterprise administrator adds a user in *Enterprise View/User Management* , he can directly specify the team to which he belongs by default and the granted role.
2. Team admins can add members in *Team View/Settings/Member Management* The options for adding are users who have been added or registered and have not joined the team.

#### Self join

Users can join any unjoined team under the enterprise by themselves. The joining process is as follows：

1. Click Join Team in *Enterprise View/Team* and select the name of the team you want to join.

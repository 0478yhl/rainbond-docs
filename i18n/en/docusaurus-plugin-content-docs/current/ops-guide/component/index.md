This article mainly introduces all the service components required for the complete deployment of Rainbond to help users understand the Rainbond technology stack and component architecture.

In the current version, the system component lifecycle is jointly maintained and managed by `Kubernetes` and `Rainbond-Operator`.

Rainbond consists of Console (console) + Region (cluster side) + Kubernetes (RKE).

## Overview of Console components

Console deployment is currently divided into three typesï¼š

1. Allinone
2. Highly available console, deployed in Rainbond (based on app store installation)
3. Helm deployment, running in Kubernetes as a POD.

## Overview of Region Cluster-side Components

The following is the Rainbond service components and their version information that will be installed on the server through one-click deployment.

- 4001 of etcd is a non-secure port, and 2379 is a secure port
- The rainbond API port does not need to be opened when there is only one data center. When there are multiple data centers and different networks, it needs to be opened to the outside world. 8888 is a non-secure port and 8443 is a secure port.
- Ports 80 and 443 provided by rbd-gateway are provided for HTTP protocol applications, and 10001~65535 are provided for TCP protocol applications.

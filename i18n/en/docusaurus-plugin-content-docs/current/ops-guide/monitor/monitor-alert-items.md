### Overview

The Rainbond monitoring service is completed by the component `rbd-monitor` In the monitor component, the Sidecar design pattern is used to integrate the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) services, and dynamically discovers the targets that need to be monitored based on etcd, and automatically configures and manages the Prometheus service.Monitor will scrape indicator data from each target regularly, and persist the data locally, providing flexible PromQL query and RESTful API query.

#### interview method

The default listening port is 9999. The default installation has added a Service object. After the cluster obtains `ServiceIP` , add a third-party service on the platform to open the external port to access.

Get `ServiceIP` way

```bash
$ kubectl get service rbd-monitor -n rbd-system
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
rbd-monitor ClusterIP 10.68.140.5   <none>        9999/TCP 7h11m
